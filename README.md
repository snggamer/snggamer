Hi, I’m snggamer 👋
I build Web3 tools for on-chain analytics, airdrop research, and RPC performance checks.
🔭 Current focus: Legion-friendly contributions (PRs/Issues), small CLI utilities, docs.
🧰 Stack: TypeScript, Python, Rust (plus Shell/Go when needed).
🌍 Based in Madrid, available for async collab.
Featured projects:
RPC Latency Checker — compare multiple endpoints, JSON export.
ABI Validator — detect incompatible events/functions, typed bindings.
Airdrop Analytics CLI — holders, top wallets, release cadence.
